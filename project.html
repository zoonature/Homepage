            Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a field that focuses on analyzing a wide range of physical phenomena occurring in fluid flow by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations. Conventional analyses rely on numerical schemes to approximate derivative and integral terms and physical models to recover flow phenomena, such as turbulence, phase change in multiphase flow, and fluid-solid interactions. However, these conventional approaches are typically exhibit problem-dependent performance limitations, primarily due to the existence of uncertainty coefficients that necessitate manual adjustments based on user experience.<br><br>
            In recent years, the integration of machine learning with CFD has emerged as a breakthrough solution to tackle this challenge. This interdisciplinary fusion holds the potential to compensate for uncertainties and optimize unknown coefficients using large datasets. Our research has successfully developed a machine learning-based shock-capturing methods that robustly and accurately captures shock waves generated around supersonic aircraft. This model is currently being applied to various real-world engineering applications in the aerospace industry, including supersonic and hypersonic vehicle.<br>
